# Simon-Game

>Simon Game is a simple game which goal is for user to repeat the pattern showed by the program. With each round a new step is added to the pattern making, the game much more difficult with every round. Additionally, the program should play a different sound for each field that is activated. On top Of that you have to enable user to switch between strict mode, which restarts a game whenever user selects wrong field in a pattern, and normal mode which only repeats the pattern subsequent of the wrong button being pressed. The provided example constituted of 4 different fields with different color for each field and I followed with the same idea.
